    """This is a QTI expression function.

    This expression looks up the value of an item variable that has been
    declared in a corresponding variable declaration or is one of the
    built-in variables. The result has the base-type and cardinality
    declared for the variable subject to the type promotion of weighted
    outcomes. During outcomes processing, values taken from an
    individual item session can be looked up by prefixing the name of
    the item variable wi- th the identifier assigned to the item in the
    qti-assessment-item-ref, separated by a per- iod character. For
    example, to obtain the value of the SCORE variable in the item
    referred to as Q01 you would use a variable instance with identifier
    Q01.SCORE. In adaptive tests that contain items that are allowed to
    be replaced (i.e. that have the with-replacement a- ttribute set to
    "true"), the same item can be instantiated more than once. In order
    to ac- cess the outcome variable values of each instantiation, a
    number that denotes the instanc- e's place in the sequence of the
    item's instantiation is inserted between the item variab- le
    identifier and the item variable, separated by a period character.
    For example, to obt- ain the value of the SCORE variable in the item
    referred to as Q01 in its second instanti- ation you would use a
    variable instance, prefixed by the instantiation sequence number, p-
    refixed by an identifier Q01.2.SCORE. When looking up the value of a
    response variable it always takes the value assigned to it by the
    candidate's last submission. Unsubmitted res- ponses are not
    available during expression evaluation. The value of an item
    variable taken from an item instantiated multiple times from the
    same qti-assessment-item-ref (through t- he use of selection with-
    replacement) is taken from the last instance submitted if submis-
    sion is simultaneous, otherwise it is undefined.
